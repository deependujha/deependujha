### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Codes I use often but don't remember:

1. **`PyTorch device (MPS, CUDA, CPU)`**

```python
import torch

# Get cpu, gpu or mps device for training.
device = (
    "cuda"
    if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else "mps"
    if torch.backends.mps.is_available()
    else "cpu"
)
print(f"Using {device} device")
```
